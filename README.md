# Service mail

 Sends emails on behalf of a Pryv.io core for user password reset and welcome emails. 

## API

### POST /sendmail/:template/:lang

Request the sending of an email, where:
- **:template** defines the type of email (e.g. welcome).
- **:lang** defines the language in which the email should be written.

Each request should contain the following body parameters:
- **substitutions**: a mapping of variables that will be substituted in the email (e.g. _{name: 'bob'}_)
- **to**: information about the recipient (in the form _{name: 'bob', email: 'bob@domain.com'}_)
- **key**: shared key used to authenticate the requesting service against the mail service

## Configuration

Service-mail can be configured by providing a configuration file (.json, .hjson or .yaml) containing settings that we list and explain below.

### Templates

Templates consist of [pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) files, arranged into folders according to email types and langage codes, see the [default templates](https://github.com/pryv/service-mail/tree/master/templates) for example.

The default root folder for templates is _/templates/_, it can be configured by providing **templates.root**.

If the template for requested language does not exist, the service will try to find another template for the same email type but with a default language (e.g. english instead of french). Default language can be defined in configuration by providing **templates.defaultLang**.

### Transport

The service-mail allows to define two types of transport, smtp or sendmail command.

#### SMTP

SMTP transport is used by default, it allows to define an external mail delivery service through configuration:
- **smtp.host**: smtp host (e.g. smtp.ethereal.email)
- **smtp.port**: smtp port (e.g. 587)
- **smtp.auth.user**, **smtp.auth.pass**: credentials to authenticate against an external mail service (e.g. sendgrid)

#### Sendmail

An alternative is to use the sendmail command of the machine on which service-mail is running.
It has to be explicitly activated through configuration:
- **sendmail.active**: true
- **sendmail.path**: path to the sendmail command on the machine

### Other settings

Here is a sample configuration that shows all available settings alongside with some explanation:

``` yml
{
  // Logging settings
  logs: {
    prefix: '',
    console: { active: true, level: 'info', colorize: true }, 
    file: { active: false },
  },
  email: {
    message: {
      // Sender name and email address
      from: {
        name: "Ethereal Email",
        address: "btvryvs5al5mjpa3@ethereal.email"
      }
    },
    preview: false, // If true, it will open a webpage with a preview
    send: true // Activate/deactivate the actual sending (prod/test env)
  },
  // By default, the service-mail will use SMTP as transport
  smtp: {
    // SMTP host of the external email delivery service
    host: "smtp.ethereal.email",
    // SMTP port
    port: 587,
    // Credentials to authenticate against SMTP server
    auth: {
      user: "btvryvs5al5mjpa3@ethereal.email",
      pass: "VfNxJctkjrURkyThZr"
    }
  },
  // Alternative transport, using the sendmail command of the machine
  sendmail: {
    // Will replace SMTP transport if set to true
    active: false,
    // Path of the sendmail command on the machine
    path: 'sendmail'
  },
  http: {
    // IP address on which the mailing server is listening
    ip: "127.0.0.1",
    // Port on which the mailing server is listening
    port: 9000,
    // Each sendmail request should contain authorization header that
    // matches this key, used to prevent abuse.
    auth: "CHANGEME",
  },
  templates: {
    // Root folder where the templates are stored
    root: '/templates/',
    // Default language for templates
    defaultLang: 'en'
  }
}
```
